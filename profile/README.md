## Stack
- React in the frontend
- Django in the backend for potential additional features (**not used in MVP**)
- Connection between the two through an API

## Description

- A basic version of the "[Shoot children's scares](https://github.com/nat-davydova/charity-hackaton-cases#shoot-children-scares-table-of-contents)" game.
- Fears appear above a child's head, click on them to make them disappear and get 25 points.
- The game stops when all fears were clicked or if it takes you more than 1 minute to kill all the fears.

## Link to the app

## Installing locally

- Front-end: clone [the repo](https://github.com/charity-hackathon-2023-team-24/frontend), then run `npm install` and `npm start`
- Back-end: see the details [here](https://github.com/charity-hackathon-2023-team-24/backend).

> [!NOTE]
> In our MVP, no backend is used (it was planned for extra features like a leaderboard), so there's no need to install it locally either.
